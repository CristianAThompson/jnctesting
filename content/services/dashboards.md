                                    Many businesses already have the core data and metrics that their day to day activities rely on. What they don't have is a single place they can go to view this data. A dashboard is a collection of
                                    graphs, tables, and widgets that gives you the ability to quickly digest all crucial business data.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Reports are structured outputs of business data. Whether its quarterly sales data or daily warehouse stock, we can wrap up your data into an exportable file that best suits your business needs. Our reports
                                    are built using tools that allow all reports to be quickly converted to PDF, Excel, JPEG or be prepared for viewing from your web site. If you still enjoy viewing your reports on paper, all of our reports
                                    are optimized for printing.
                                </p>
